Enhanced Commercial
Umbrella Liability Policy
Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Please read the entire policy carefully to determine rights,
duties and what is and is not covered.
Throughout this policy the words ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to the “Named Insured” shown in the Declarations and any
other person or organization qualifying as a “Named Insured” under this policy. The words ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refer
to the company providing this insurance.
Other words and phrases that appear in “quotation marks” have special meaning. Refer to Section VII -
DEFINITIONS.
We, the company named in the Declarations, relying upon the statements made and information furnished to us,
and in return for the payment of premium and subject to the terms, conditions, and limits of insurance of this
policy, agree as follows:
I.
INSURING AGREEMENT – COMMERCIAL UMBRELLA LIABILITY
A. “Bodily Injury” and “Property Damage” Liability
1.
We will pay on behalf of the “insured” those sums in excess of the “retained limit” that the “insured”
becomes legally obligated to pay as damages imposed by law or assumed by the “insured” under an
“insured contract” because of “bodily injury” or “property damage” to which this insurance applies.
2.
This insurance applies to “bodily injury” and “property damage”, but only if:
a.
The “bodily injury” or “property damage” is caused by an “occurrence” that takes place in the
“coverage territory”;
b.
The “bodily injury” or “property damage” occurs during the “policy period”; and
c.
Prior to the “policy period”, no “insured” listed in paragraph 2. of the definition of “insured” and
no “employee” authorized by you to give or receive notice of an “occurrence” or claim knew that
the “bodily injury” or “property damage” had occurred, in whole or in part. If such listed “insured”
or authorized “employee” knew, prior to the “policy period”, that the “bodily injury” or “property
damage” occurred, then any continuation, change or resumption of such “bodily injury” or
“property damage” during or after the “policy period” will be deemed to have been known prior to
the “policy period”.
3.
“Bodily injury” or “property damage” that occurs during the “policy period” and was not, prior to the
“policy period”, known to have occurred by any “insured” listed in paragraph 2. of the definition of
“insured” or any “employee” authorized by you to give or receive notice of an “occurrence” or claim,
includes any continuation, change or resumption of that “bodily injury” or “property damage” after
the end of the “policy period”.
4.
“Bodily injury” or “property damage” will be deemed to have been known to have occurred at the
earliest time when any “insured” listed in paragraph 2. of the definition of “insured” or any
“employee” authorized by you to give or receive notice of an “occurrence” or claim:
a.
Reports all or any part of the “bodily injury” or “property damage” to us or any other insurer;
b.
Receives a written or verbal demand or claim for damages because of the “bodily injury” or
“property damage”; or
c.
Becomes aware by any other means that “bodily injury” or “property damage” has occurred or has
begun to occur.
5.
Damages because of “bodily injury” include damages claimed by any person or organization for care,
loss of services or death resulting at any time from the “bodily injury”.
B. “Personal and Advertising Injury” Liability
1.
We will pay on behalf of the “insured” those sums in excess of the “retained limit” that the “insured”
becomes legally obligated to pay as damages by reason of liability imposed by law because of
Enhanced Commercial
Umbrella Liability Policy
XSE- 50762(05/18)
Page 2 of 27
“personal and advertising injury” to which this insurance applies.
2.
This insurance applies to “personal and advertising injury”, but only if:
a.
The “personal and advertising injury” arises out of your business;
b.
The “personal and advertising injury” is caused by an “occurrence” that takes place in the
“coverage territory”; and
c.
The “occurrence” causing the “personal and advertising injury” was committed during the “policy
period”.
II. INSURING AGREEMENT – CATASTROPHE MANAGEMENT INSURANCE
A.
We will pay to third parties, on behalf of and at the request of the “insured”, “catastrophe management
costs” arising out of injury or damage that, in the good faith opinion of a “key individual”, has resulted in
or is reasonably likely to result in a “catastrophe management event” first commencing during the “policy
period”, up to the amount of the Catastrophe Management Aggregate Limit shown in the Declarations.
B.
This coverage part applies only to “catastrophe management costs” arising out of a “catastrophe
management event” that occurs during the “policy period”.
C.
Our obligation to pay “catastrophe management costs” will end when we determine that the necessary
elements listed in the definition of “catastrophe management event” no longer exist or when the
Catastrophe Management Aggregate Limit shown in the Declarations has been exhausted, whichever
occurs first.
D. Any payment of “catastrophe management costs” that we make will not:
1.
Be a determination of any other rights or obligations under this policy;
2.
Create any duty to defend any “suit” under any other part of this policy; or
3.
Operate as a waiver of any right or defense we have with respect to the coverage under this policy,
including the Condition titled Duties In The Event Of “Occurrence”, Claim Or “Suit”.
E.
We have no obligation under this coverage part with respect to any “catastrophe management costs”
incurred or paid without our prior consent, which will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
F.
We have no other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services under this coverage part.
G.
Payment of covered “catastrophe management costs” shall not be subject to the “retained limit”.
III.DUTY TO DEFEND AND “DEFENSE COSTS”
A.
We will have the right and duty to defend the “insured” against any “suit” seeking damages for “bodily
injury”, “property damage” or “personal and advertising injury” to which this insurance applies, even if
groundless, false or fraudulent:
1.
When such damages would be covered by “underlying insurance” but are not covered because of the
exhaustion of the applicable limits of “underlying insurance” by the payment of “loss” to which this
insurance applies, and the total applicable limits of any “other insurance” have been exhausted; or
2.
When such damages are not covered by “underlying insurance” and any applicable self-insured
retention, including the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention”, has been exhausted by the
payment of “loss” to which this insurance applies, and the total applicable limits of any “other
insurance” have been exhausted; or
3.
When damages sought for “bodily injury”, “property damage” or “personal and advertising injury” are
subject to a “scheduled retained limit” and such “scheduled retained limit” has been exhausted by the
payment of “loss” to which this insurance applies and the total applicable limits of any “other
insurance” have been exhausted.
Enhanced Commercial
Umbrella Liability Policy
XSE- 50762(05/18)
Page 3 of 27
B.
We will have no duty to defend the “insured” against any “suit” seeking damages for “bodily injury”,
“property damage” or “personal and advertising injury” to which this insurance does not apply.
C.
Except as provided in Paragraph A., we will have no duty to defend any “suit” against the “insured”. We
will, however, have the right, but not the duty, to associate in the investigation of any claim and the
defense of any “suit” that may, in our opinion, result in damages to which this insurance applies. If we
exercise this right, we will do so at our own expense.
D. If we assume the defense of any claim or “suit” against the “insured”, we will:
1.
Investigate, negotiate and settle the claim or “suit” at our discretion; and
2.
Pay “defense costs” to the extent that such “defense costs” are not covered by “underlying insurance”
or any applicable “other insurance”.
E.
Our right and duty to defend ends when the applicable Limit of Insurance of this policy has been
exhausted by the payment of “loss”.
IV. LIMITS OF INSURANCE AND “RETAINED LIMIT”
A.
The Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations and the rules below fix the most we will pay regardless
of the number of:
1.
“Insureds”;
2.
Claims made or “suits” brought; or
3.
Persons or organizations making claims or bringing “suits”.
B.
The General Aggregate Limit shown in the Declarations is the most we will pay for all damages, except:
1.
Damages because of “bodily injury” or “property damage” included in the “products-completed
operations hazard”;
2.
Damages because of “bodily injury” or “property damage” arising out of “auto liability”; and
3.
“Catastrophe management costs”.
C.
The Products-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit shown in the Declarations is the most we will pay
for damages because of “bodily injury” and “property damage” included in the “products-completed
operations hazard”.
D. Subject to Paragraphs B and C above, the Each Occurrence Limit shown in the Declarations is the most we
will pay for the sum of all damages because of “bodily injury”, “property damage”, and “personal and
advertising injury” arising out of any one “occurrence”. However, this Each Occurrence Limit shall not
apply to “catastrophe management costs”.
E.
The Catastrophe Management Aggregate Limit is the most we will pay for the sum of all “catastrophe
management costs” under this policy, regardless of the number of “catastrophe management events” first
commencing during the “policy period”.
F.
Subject to E. above, the Catastrophe Management Each Occurrence Limit shown in the Declarations is the
most we will pay for the sum of all “catastrophe management costs” arising out of any one “occurrence”.
G.
“Defense costs” will be in addition to the applicable Limits of Insurance of this policy unless an exception
set forth in subparagraphs 1. or 2. below applies.
If:
1.
“Defense costs” reduce the applicable limits of “underlying insurance”; or
2.
A coverage listed in a Schedule of Retained Limits attached to this policy indicates that “defense
costs” are included within the “retained limit”;
Enhanced Commercial
Umbrella Liability Policy
XSE- 50762(05/18)
Page 4 of 27
then such “defense costs”, other than post-judgment interest, will reduce the applicable Limits of
Insurance of this policy.
H. The Limits of Insurance and applicable “retained limit” of this policy apply separately to each consecutive
annual period and to any remaining period of less than twelve (12) months, starting with the beginning of
the “policy period” shown in the Declarations, unless the “policy period” is extended after issuance for an
additional period of less than twelve (12) months. In that case, the additional period will be deemed part
of the last preceding period for purposes of determining the Limits of Insurance and “retained limit”.
I.
If the applicable “retained limit” has been:
1.
Reduced by the payment of “loss”, then this policy will be excess of the reduced “retained limit”.
2.
Exhausted by the payment of “loss”, then this policy will continue in force as “underlying insurance”.
This policy recognizes reduction or exhaustion of “underlying insurance”, any applicable self-insured
retention, and any applicable “scheduled retained limit” only by payment of “loss” to which this policy
applies.
J.
Where damages for “bodily injury” or “property damage” included within the “liquor liability hazard” are
not covered by “underlying insurance”, except due to the exhaustion of such “underlying insurance” by the
payment of “loss” to which this policy applies, the amount we will pay for such damages shall be excess of
the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention” or “scheduled retained limit” as applicable, and any
applicable “other insurance”.
K.
Subject to L. below, where amounts payable pursuant to an exception to an exclusion of this policy are
expressly subject to the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention”, the amount we will pay for damages
subject to such exception shall be excess of the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention” and any
applicable “other insurance”.
L.
If there is “other insurance” purchased by the “Named Insured” applicable to a “loss” subject to the
“enhanced coverage self-insured retention”, amounts received through such “other insurance” purchased
by the “Named Insured” for the payment of such “loss” covered by this policy may be applied to reduce or
exhaust the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention”.
M. If there is “underlying insurance”, or “other insurance” purchased by the “Named Insured”, applicable to a
“loss” subject to a “scheduled retained limit”, amounts received through such “underlying insurance”, or
such “other insurance” purchased by the “Named Insured”, for the payment of such “loss” covered by this
policy may be applied to reduce or exhaust the “scheduled retained limit”.
N. If there is applicable “underlying insurance” with a policy period that is non-concurrent with the “policy
period” of this policy, the “retained limit” with respect to any coverage provided by this policy excess of
such “underlying insurance” will only be reduced or exhausted by payments for:
a.
“Bodily injury” or “property damage” that occurs during the “policy period” of this policy; or
b.
“Personal and advertising injury” for “occurrences” that are committed during the “policy period” of
this policy.
However, if any applicable “underlying insurance” is written on a claims-made basis, the “retained limit”
with respect to any coverage provided by this policy excess of such “underlying insurance” will only be
reduced or exhausted by claims for that insurance that are made during the “policy period”, or any
Extended Reporting Period, applicable to this policy.
O. “Defense costs” shall not reduce or exhaust the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention” or the
“umbrella coverage self-insured retention”. “Defense costs” shall not reduce or exhaust a “scheduled
retained limit” unless specifically noted in the Schedule of Retained Limits or endorsement setting forth
such “scheduled retained limit”.

We will be permitted, but not obligated, to inspect the “insured’s” property and operations. Neither
our right to make inspections, nor the making thereof, nor any report thereon, will constitute an
undertaking on behalf of or for the benefit of the “insured”, or others, to determine or warrant that
such property or operations are safe.
2.
We may examine and audit the “insured’s” books and records during the “policy period”, and any
extensions thereof, within three (3) years after the termination date of this policy.
•
Legal Action Against Us
1.
No person or organization has a right under this policy to join us as a party or otherwise bring us into
a “suit” asking for damages from an “insured”.
2.
No person or organization has a right of action against us under this policy unless all of its terms have
been fully complied with and the amount that such person or organization seeks to recover has been
determined by settlement with our consent or by final judgment against an “insured”.
•
Maintenance of “Underlying Insurance”
The policy or policies referred to in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance or renewals or replacements
thereof not more restrictive in coverage will be maintained in full effect during this “policy period”, except
for any reduction of the aggregate limits solely by payment of “loss” to which this policy applies.
If, during the “policy period”, such “underlying insurance” is not maintained in full effect or is materially
changed to be more restrictive in coverage, or if any limits of liability of “underlying insurance” are:
1.
Less than as stated in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance; or
2.
Unavailable due to bankruptcy or insolvency of an underlying insurer;
then the insurance afforded by this policy will apply in the same manner as if such “underlying insurance”
and limits of liability had been in effect, available, so maintained and unchanged.
Neither the failure to maintain the “underlying insurance” as required by this condition nor the
bankruptcy, insolvency, or refusal or inability to pay of any underlying insurer shall invalidate this policy.
However, this policy will apply only to the same extent that it would have if the “underlying insurance”
were maintained as required by this condition and the underlying insurer had not become bankrupt,
insolvent or refused or was unable to pay, excess of a self-insured retention equal to the highest applicable
limit of such “underlying insurance”. This provision shall not apply to coverages specifically designated to
be excess of the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention” or excess of a “scheduled retained limit”.
•
“Other insurance”
If valid and collectible “other insurance” applies to damages that are also covered by this policy, this
Enhanced Commercial
Umbrella Liability Policy
XSE- 50762(05/18)
Page 16 of 27
policy will apply excess of the “other insurance” and will not contribute with such “other insurance”. This
provision will not apply if the “other insurance” is written to be excess of this policy.
•
Premium
The first “Named Insured” shown in the Declarations will be responsible for payment of all premiums
when due.
The premium stated in the Declarations is a flat premium. It is not subject to adjustment except as
provided herein or as changed by an endorsement to this policy issued by us.
•
Separation of “Insureds”
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, the “retained limit”, and any rights or duties specifically
assigned to the first “Named Insured”, this insurance applies:
1.
As if each “Named Insured” were the only “Named Insured”; and
2.
Separately to each “insured” against whom claim is made or “suit” is brought.
•
Titles
The titles to the various parts, sections, subsections and endorsements of this policy are intended solely
for ease of reference and do not in any way limit, expand or otherwise affect the provisions of such parts,
sections, subsections and endorsements.
•
Transfer of Rights of Recovery Against Others to Us
1.
If the “insured” has rights to recover all or part of any payment we have made under this policy, those
rights are transferred to us. Subject to paragraph 3. below, the “insured” must do nothing to impair
them. At our request, the “insured” will bring “suit” or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce
them.
2.
Any amount recovered will be apportioned in the inverse order of payment of “loss” to the extent of
actual payment. The expenses of all such recovery proceedings will be apportioned in the ratio of
respective recoveries.
3.
If you waive any right of recovery against a specific person or organization for damages as required
under an “insured contract”, we will also waive, to the same extent, such right of recovery we may
have against such person or organization provided that the “bodily injury” or “property damage”
occurs subsequent to the execution of the “insured contract”.
•
Unintentional Failure to Disclose
Your failure to disclose all hazards or prior “occurrences” existing as of the inception date of this policy
shall not prejudice the coverage afforded by this policy provided such failure to disclose all hazards or
prior “occurrences” is not intentional.
•
When “Loss” is Payable
Coverage under this policy does not apply to a given claim unless and until:
1. The “insured” or “insured's” underlying insurer has become obligated to pay the “retained limit” and
2. The obligation of the “insured” to pay the “loss” in excess of the “retained limit” has been determined
by a final settlement or judgment or written agreement among the “insured”, claimant and us.

THIS ENDORSEMENT APPLIES ONLY WHEN A “FOREIGN OCCURRENCE”, ARISING OUT OF A
“FOREIGN BUSINESS OPERATION” AND CAUSING “BODILY INJURY”, “PROPERTY DAMAGE”
OR “PERSONAL AND ADVERTISING INJURY”, TAKES PLACE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE ARE
NOT “LICENSED”.
The policy is amended as follows:
FIRST NAMED INSURED INDEMNITY COVERAGE
1.
INSURING AGREEMENT
This endorsement applies only when a “foreign occurrence”, arising out of a “foreign business operation” and
causing “bodily injury”, “property damage” or “personal and advertising injury”, takes place in a country
where we are not “licensed”. In that case, rather than directly pay on behalf of and defend your “foreign
business operation”, we will indemnify the “First Named Insured”, in excess of the “retained limit”, for “loss”
and defense and supplementary payments in accordance with this endorsement. This endorsement provides
the only coverage under the policy for “bodily injury”, “property damage” or “personal and advertising injury”
arising out of a “foreign occurrence”.

The definition of “insured” in Section VII. DEFINITIONS is amended to provide that a “foreign business
operation” is not an “insured” on whose behalf we have a direct duty to pay settlements or judgments or a
direct duty to defend under this policy.
3.
DUTY TO DEFEND AND “DEFENSE COSTS” - ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS
When this endorsement applies, rather than directly defend your “foreign business operation”, we will
indemnify the “First Named Insured” for “defense costs” incurred in defending a “suit” brought against a
“foreign business operation”, provided that (a) the “foreign business operation” gives the “First Named
Insured” the right to control the investigation, defense and settlement of the “suit” and (b) the “First Named
Insured” assigns this right to us. We will associate with the “First Named Insured” to conduct such
investigation, defense and settlement as provided in Section III. DUTY TO DEFEND AND “DEFENSE
COSTS”, except that we will indemnify the “First Named Insured” rather than directly defend and pay
supplementary payments.
4.
LIMITS OF INSURANCE
A.
The insurance provided by this endorsement is subject to the applicable aggregate and each occurrence
limits of insurance stated in the Declarations, and any “losses” for which we pay indemnity will erode and
be counted against such limits.
XSE-52234 (03/19)
Page 2 of 3
B.
Subject to the applicable aggregate and each “occurrence” limits of insurance stated in the Declarations,
our limit of insurance for “loss” will be the amount which the “First Named Insured”:
1.
Has indemnified a “foreign business operation”, or
2.
Represents to us that it is obligated to indemnify the “foreign business operation”.
However, if this policy provides for a percentage allocation of liability with respect to the “insured’s” or the
“foreign business operation’s” interest in a joint venture, limited liability company or partnership, the
allocation set forth in such provision will apply.
5.
The terms, conditions and limitations set forth in Section IV. LIMITS OF INSURANCE AND
“RETAINED LIMIT” in the policy will apply to our duty to indemnify the “First Named Insured”.
6.
CONDITIONS
When this endorsement applies, the following conditions apply in addition to the conditions and limitations
provided elsewhere in the policy.
A.
Claims Made/Reported Coverage (if applicable)
Any requirements in the policy that a claim be first made during the “policy period” or any discovery or
extended reporting period will also apply to all claims made against a “foreign business operation” for
which the “First Named Insured” seeks indemnification.
B.
Additional Notice Duties of the “First Named Insured”
With respect to a “foreign occurrence” which may result in a claim for damages under this endorsement,
the “First Named Insured” assumes the duty to notify us, and must notify us in accordance with the
standards described in Section VI. CONDITIONS, Duties in the Event of “Occurrence”, Claim or
“Suit” in the policy.
7.
PROOF OF INSURANCE
This policy may not be offered as proof of insurance unless permitted by local applicable law.
8.
Truthfulness and Accuracy of Material Information
When this endorsement applies, the “First Named Insured”:
1.
Is responsible for the truthfulness and accuracy of any material information provided to us with respect to
a “foreign business operation”, “foreign occurrence”, claim, “suit” or “loss”; and
2.
Will not, at any time, intentionally conceal or misrepresent a material fact concerning this policy,
including the risk to be insured, a “foreign business operation”, a “loss”, claim or “suit” or a “foreign

the “foreign business operation” is legally liable to pay as damages because of “bodily injury”, “property

damage” that the “insured” would have in the absence of such request, demand, order, statutory or
regulatory requirement, claim or “suit” by or on behalf of a governmental authority.
Where any coverage provided by this policy for “bodily injury” or ”property damage” arising out of the
actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of “pollutants” is
not provided by applicable “underlying insurance”, except due to the exhaustion of such “underlying
insurance” by “loss” to which this policy applies, the coverage for such “bodily injury” or ”property
damage” shall be provided excess of the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention”. This provision shall
not apply if pollution coverage is provided excess of a “scheduled retained limit”, in which case, the
“scheduled retained limit” and not the “enhanced coverage self-insured retention” shall apply.
All other terms and conditions of the policy remain unchanged.

THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:
ENHANCED COMMERCIAL UMBRELLA LIABILITY POLICY
The policy is amended as follows:
1.
Section VI. CONDITIONS is amended to add the following condition:
•
Punitive Damages
1.
“Punitive damages” because of “bodily injury”, “property damage” or “personal and advertising
injury” will be considered damages to which this insurance applies, but only if:
a.
The “punitive damages” are awarded by a court of law in a judgment against the “insured”; and
b.
The same judgment also awards compensatory damages against the “insured” that (1) arise out of
the same “occurrence” and (2) are otherwise covered by this insurance. However, this condition
shall not apply where the law of the U.S. jurisdiction under which the “punitive damages” were
awarded does not permit an award of compensatory damages for such cause of action; and
c.
Such award of “punitive damages” is permitted to be covered by insurance under the law of a U.S.
jurisdiction that has a “substantial relationship” to the “insured”, us, or this policy.
If all three of conditions a., b., and c. above are satisfied, we will follow the law of such jurisdiction
that is most favorable to the “insured” in determining whether such “punitive damages” are insurable,
and if they are insurable under the law of such jurisdiction, we will pay on behalf of the “insured”
those sums in excess of the “retained limit” that the “insured” is liable to pay as a result of the award,
subject to the limitations in sections (2) through (4) below, the limits of insurance and all other terms
and conditions of the policy. No choice of law issue which may arise out of a claim or “suit”, other
than the insurability of “punitive damages”, shall be affected by this endorsement.
2.
“Punitive damages” will not be considered damages to which this insurance applies, and we will have
no obligation with respect to such damages, if:
a.
The “insured” seeking coverage for an award of “punitive damages”, brings a “suit” against us
seeking a declaration of coverage under the policy in a jurisdiction that does not recognize or
permit the insurability of the “punitive damages” award; or
b.
The court that enters the judgment awarding “punitive damages” against the “insured” also orders
that the “insured” may not seek insurance coverage for “punitive damages”.
3.
This endorsement is subject to all exclusions in the policy, including but not limited to, the Expected
or Intended Injury exclusion.
4.
Any award of “punitive damages” and compensatory damages arising out of the same judgment will
be added together and the sum shall be used to determine whether or not the “retained limit” has
been exhausted.
5.
Where any coverage provided by this policy for “punitive damages” is not provided by applicable
“underlying insurance”, except due to the exhaustion of such “underlying insurance” by “loss” to
XSE-52634a (06/20)
Page 2 of 2
which this policy applies, the coverage for such “punitive damages” shall be provided excess of the
“enhanced coverage self-insured retention”. Notwithstanding the above, the Enhanced Coverage Self-
Insured Retention – Aggregate shall not apply to amounts payable for “punitive damages”.
2.
Section VII. DEFINITIONS is amended to add the following definitions:
•
“Punitive damages”, which may also be called exemplary damages, means damages awarded by a court
above and beyond the requirements for compensating a plaintiff for “bodily injury”, “property damage” or
“personal and advertising injury” and intended to reform or deter the defendant and similar persons from
pursuing a course of action such as that which damaged the plaintiff. “Punitive damages” does not include
civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed by any government authority.
•
“Substantial relationship” means a relationship with one or more of the following indicia: the “insured’s”
state of incorporation or principal place of business; the place where the claim is made or the court action
seeking damages is brought, or where the “bodily injury”, “property damage”, or “personal and advertising
injury” occurred; the insurance company’s state of domicile, incorporation, or principal place of business;
or the state where the policy was issued.
3.
Section VII. DEFINITIONS, “Enhanced coverage self-insured retention” is amended to add the
following provision:
Additionally, the Enhanced Coverage Self-Insured Retention – Aggregate shall not apply to amounts
payable for “punitive damages.
All other terms and conditions of the policy remain unchanged.
