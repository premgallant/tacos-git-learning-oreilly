In the event of Time Element Loss insured hereunder resulting from direct physical loss or

shall be limited to: 
 
- 
the Property Damage Value at the time of loss for each Ally Financial Inc. location 
contributing to the claimed Property Damage loss insured hereunder; and 
 
- 
the Business Interruption Values for the 365 days following the date of loss, for 
each Ally Financial Inc. location contributing to the Time Element loss insured 
hereunder. 
 
For Contingent Business Interruption/Contingent Extra Expense loss, when a deductible is 
not specifically stated as applying to Contingent Business Interruption/Contingent Extra 
Expense, the deductible for Contingent Business Interruption/Contingent Extra Expense 
loss will be determined as though the Contingent Business Interruption/Contingent Extra 
Expense location was an insured location under this Policy. 
 
Whether the claim involves loss at one or more locations, the deductible amount shall apply 
against the total loss suffered by the Insured from any one Occurrence. If two or more 
deductible amounts in this policy apply to a single Occurrence, the total to be deducted 
shall not exceed the largest deductible applicable unless; however, the application of 
separate deductibles will increase payment to the Insured, then separate deductibles may 
apply. 
 
In any Occurrence where loss or damage is caused by more than one peril insured against 
under this policy, the Insured shall have the right to separate the loss amount by peril for 
the purposes of application of the deductible(s) specified in this section, notwithstanding 
the above reference to two or more deductibles. 
 
The deductible amount specified in above shall not apply to General Average contributions 
and/or salvage charges. 
 
If any other insurance applies to the same property as insured hereunder, and to the extent 
recovery is made from such other insurance, the deductible under this policy shall be 
reduced by such recovery, but in no event shall the deductible under this policy be less than 
shown in the policy.  If recovery from such other insurance is greater than the deductible 
in this policy, then the deductible under this policy shall not apply. 
 
In any Occurrence where loss or damage is caused by more than one cause of loss or 
damage (peril) insured against under this policy, the Insured shall have the right to separate 
the loss amount by peril for the purposes of application of the deductible(s) specified in 
this section, notwithstanding the above reference to two or more deductibles and the policy 
limits.

corporations or companies, joint ventures, partnerships or individuals, or any other 
party required to be insured, or any other corporations or companies associated 
with the Insured through ownership or management is waived, and at the option of

In the event of any payment under this policy, except where subrogation rights 
have been waived, the Insurer shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment 
to all the Insured’s rights of recovery therefore.  The Insured shall execute all 
papers required and shall take reasonable and necessary action to secure such 
subrogation rights.  The Insurer will act in concert with all other interests 
concerned, i.e., the Insured and any other company(ies) participating in the 
payment of any loss as primary or excess insurers, in the exercise of such rights of 
recovery.  If any amount is recovered, after deducting the costs or recovery, such 
amount shall be divided between the interests concerned in the proportion of their

borne by the party instituting the proceedings.

for the Insured, their factors, servants or assignees, to sue, labor and travel for, in and about 
the defense, safeguard and recovery of the property insured hereunder, or any part thereof, 
without prejudice of this insurance.  Nor shall the acts of the Insured or these Insurers in 
recovering, saving, and preserving the property insured in case of actual or imminent loss 
or damage, be considered a waiver or acceptance of an abandonment.  The Insurer will be 
responsible for all expenses.  The deductible provision of this policy shall not apply to this 
clause.  This provision does not increase the limit of liability of this policy.

22. 
Appraisal 
 
In case the Insured and this Insurer shall fail to agree as to the amount of loss, then, on the 
written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and 
notify the other of the appraiser selected within Twenty (20) days of such demand.  The 
appraisers shall select a competent and disinterested umpire; and, failing for Fifteen (15) 
days to agree upon such umpire, then on request of the Insured or the Insurer, such umpire 
shall be selected by a judge of a district court of a judicial district in accordance with the 
Jurisdiction and Suit clause of this policy.  The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, 
separating the loss to each item; and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences only to 
the umpire.  An award in writing, so itemized of any two when filed with the Insurer, shall 
determine the amount of loss.  Each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting each 
respective appraiser and the expenses of appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties 
equally. However, if the award is greater than the amount offered by the Insurer in 
payment of the loss at any time before the award is rendered, then the Insurer shall pay 
100% of the fees and expenses for each appraiser and the umpire and for the appraisal.

the customary manner, at the expense of the Insurer, of all such brands or trademarks or 
other identifying characteristics.

and shall retain control of all damaged property.  The Insured, exercising reasonable 
discretion, shall be the sole judge as to whether the property involved in any loss under this 
policy are fit for consumption, sale or use and any property so deemed by the Insured to be 
unfit for consumption, sale or use shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of except by the 
Insured or with the Insured’s consent, but the Insured shall allow this Insurer any salvage 
proceeds obtained by the Insured on any sale or other disposition of such property. 
 
25. 
Salvage and Recoveries 
 
Except as described in Clause 24, after expenses incurred in salvage or recovery are 
deducted, any salvage or other recovery, except recovery through subrogation proceedings 
and/or from underlying and/or excess insurance as described herein, shall accrue entirely 
to the benefit of this Insurer until the sum paid by the Insurer has been recovered.

as interest(s) may appear, and this insurance, as to the interest(s) of the mortgagee(s) (or 
trustee(s)) only therein, shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or 
owner of the described property, nor by any foreclosure or other proceedings or notice of

nor by the occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by 
this policy provided that in case the mortgagor or owner shall neglect to pay any premium 
due under this policy, the mortgagee (or trustee) shall, on demand, pay the same.  Provided 
also, that the mortgagee (or trustee) shall notify this Insurer of any change of ownership 
or occupancy or increase of hazard which shall come to the knowledge of said mortgagee 
(or trustee) and, unless permitted by this policy, it shall be noted thereon and the mortgagee 
(or trustee) shall, on demand, pay the premium for such increased hazard for the term of 
use thereof; otherwise, this policy shall be null and void. 
 
This Insurer reserves the right to cancel this policy at any time as provided by its terms, 
but in such case this policy shall continue in force for the benefit only of the mortgagee (or 
trustee) for Ten (10) days after notice to the mortgagee (or trustee) of such cancellation 
and shall then cease and this Insurer shall have the right, on like notice, to cancel this

Wherever this Insurer shall pay the mortgagee (or trustee) any sum for loss or damage 
under this policy, and shall claim that as the mortgagor or owner, no liability therefore 
existed, this Insurer shall, to the extent of such payment, be thereupon legally subrogated 
to all the rights of the party to whom such payment shall be made. 
 
44.

be canceled by the Insurer by mailing via registered or certified mail to Ally Financial Inc.

Inspection and Audit 
 
This Insurer shall be permitted, but not obligated, to inspect the Insured’s property at any

into the currency of the United States of America shall be calculated as follows:

reconditioning shall be converted, at the option of the Insured, based on any of the

Journal as of the date of loss. 
 
B.

In the event that a loss insured hereunder cannot be paid in the country where the 
loss insured under this policy has occurred, this Insurer shall be liable for an 
additional loss payment in accordance with the following formula: 
 
 
 
 
Loss payment due under this section = (III-I)  MINUS III

defined as: 
 
 
 
I. 
local tax benefit received where the loss occurred.

this clause. 
 
 
B. 
Should the effective local tax rate where the loss occurs be equal to or greater than

the formula stated in Clause A. above shall not apply.  The tax rates applicable 
shall be the respective corporate tax rates in effect for the fiscal year when the loss 
occurred. 
 
49. 
Difference in Conditions 
 
Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, coverage under this policy is to 
apply only when coverage and/or definitions and/or conditions set forth herein are broader 
in meaning or scope than those of specific underlying or primary policies.  The insurance 
provided by this policy will apply as contributing or excess insurance as respects loss 
arising from loss or damage insured under such other policies.  In the absence of any other 
valid and collectible insurance, this policy shall become primary, subject to the terms and 
conditions of this policy. 
 
50. 
Tax Treatment of Profits 
 
This policy is extended to insure the additional loss sustained by the Insured resulting from 
loss or damage insured by this policy in the event the tax treatment of: 
 
A. 
the profit portion of a loss recovery involving finished stock manufactured or

the profit portion of business interruption loss proceeds; 
differs from the tax treatment of profits that would have been incurred had no loss 
occurred.

policy(s) effected by the Insured.  If, after determination of the amount of loss under each 
local policy, the Insured shall be unable to collect the same in full as a result of the 
application of the coinsurance or average clause, this policy shall pay the difference 
between the amount recoverable under the local policy(s) and the total amount of the loss. 
 
53. 
Currency Devaluation 
 
This policy covers any deficiency in the amount of collectible loss under a primary

Severability of Interest 
 
Each of the Insureds insured by this policy will have the same protection and obligations 
as if the policy has been issued individually to each of them, except as respects the 
obligations associated with Clause 44. Cancellation.  However, the inclusion of more than 
one Insured will not operate to increase the limit of liability of the Insurer beyond the limit 
of liability stated in this policy. 
 
55.

It is hereby understood and agreed that each and every loss will be adjusted by Amy 
O’Rorke of Sedgwick or its successor company unless otherwise agreed by the Insured and
